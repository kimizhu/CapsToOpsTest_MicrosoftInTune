# Manage app access to Office 365 services
Insert introduction here.

## How app access can protect your data
With MAM policies, you can configure policies that prevent corporate data from being transferred to the device or to non-protected apps.

With app access restrictions, access to company cloud resources like Exchange Online and SharePoint online can be managed.  You can configure which apps should be allowed access to your cloud resources and only those apps will be able to access the resource. If the end-user tries to access using other apps, access is blocked.
