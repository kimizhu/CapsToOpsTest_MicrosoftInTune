# Rollout phases for Microsoft Intune deployment
This topic describes the phases that are generally associated with a service deployment.

## Rollout phases

- **[Proof of concept](../Topic/Proof_of_concept.md):** Test technical deployment &amp; network architecture.

- **[Pilot](../Topic/Pilot.md):** With a sample of enrolled devices, validate scenarios, resources, and rollout plans with user in preparation for broad rollout.

- **[Enterprise rollout](../Topic/Enterprise_rollout.md):** Launch across all departments and user groups.
